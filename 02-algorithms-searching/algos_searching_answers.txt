1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

	- It would take 7 iterations to find G using linear search.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

	- It would take 3 interations to find G using binary search.

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

	- fib(10) = 55
	- fib(11) = 89
	- fib(12) = 144

4. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, 
which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

	- If the collection is unsorted, I would use linear search because
	  binary wouldn't be able to determine whether the desired value is 
	  greater or less than the 'mid' value. I would choose to use an 
	  iterative solution because there's no benefit in using recursive
	  for something as simple as a linear search. 


5. Given a sorted collection of a million items, 
which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

	- If the colection is sorted, using a binary search would be most
	  efficient because it's essentially dividing the size of the collection
	  by half with each iteration. I would choose to use an iterative solution
	  because it's more straight-forward.
